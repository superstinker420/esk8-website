					<h2>Research/Inspiration</h2>
					<p>Before starting the build process, I did some research and looked for inspiration on various websites and forums. I also decided on the design and specifications for my electric skateboard.</p>

					<h2>Battery Build</h2>
					<p>The battery is the most important part of an electric skateboard, so I decided to build my own using 18650 lithium-ion cells. I followed a tutorial online to assemble the battery pack and added a battery management system for safety.</p>

					<h2>Electronics</h2>
					<p>After building the battery, I started working on the electronics. I used an ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) and a motor to control the speed of the skateboard. I also added a remote control for easy operation.</p>

					<h2>Putting Everything Together</h2>
					<p>Finally, I assembled all the parts together to complete the electric skateboard. I made sure all the connections were secure and tested the skateboard before riding it for the first time.</p>
